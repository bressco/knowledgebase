## FAIRagro Search Hub
<!--Text größtenteils identisch mit "FAIRagro Infrastruktur-Suche"-Abschnitt unter Repositories-->
FAIRagro has set itself the goal of connecting existing research data infrastructures (RDIs) with one another.
This is realized externally primarily through the data search portal of the FAIRagro Search Hub.
In addition, a compilation of different infrastructures/repositories will also be searchable according to various criteria.  
The data search as well as the infrastructure search is currently still under construction.
As soon as further information is available, you will find it here and on our FAIRagro website.

## SciWIn Client
SciWIn Client is a command-line tool for building reproducible data pipelines using the _Common Workflow Language (CWL)_. SciWIn Client helps researchers define individual analysis steps as CWL specifications and assemble them into complete workflows with simple commands.
By formalizing analytical processes, SciWIn Client improves reproducibility, transparency, and reusability of computational methods. It facilitates documentation, versioning, and sharing of workflows, supporting collaborative and sustainable research practices.
