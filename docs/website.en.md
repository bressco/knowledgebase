The FAIRagro consortium with more than 30 partners is building a FAIR (**F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, **R**eusable) research data management system for the agrosystems research community.
We are developing the right tools and workflows to lay the foundations for sustainable crop production – now and in the future.
