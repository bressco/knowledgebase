# What services does FAIRagro offer in the field of RDM and how do they work?

Many aspects of research data management (RDM) sound very theoretical at first.
To facilitate practical implementation, FAIRagro has set itself the goal of developing and providing services in the field of RDM.

Often, questions arise such as: 
*Where can I find data that I can reuse for my own research?* (&rarr; [FAIRagro Search Hub](#fairagro-search-hub)), 
*How can I automate my workflow?* (&rarr; [SciWIn Client](#sciwin-client)), or
*Are there templates I can use for my data management plan (DMP)?* (&rarr; [DMP Templates](#dmp-templates)).

A general overview of FAIRagro services can also be found on our [website](https://fairagro.net/en/){:target="_blank"}.


## [FAIRagro Search Hub](https://search-hub.fairagro.net/){:target="_blank"}
A central element of FAIRagro Services is the [Search Hub](https://search-hub.fairagro.net/){:target="_blank"}.
It consists of two different search functions: data search and infrastructure search.

The FAIRagro Search Hub's **data search** function enables users to search all connected research data infrastructures (RDIs) simultaneously, eliminating the need for separate searches in each individual RDI.
The Search Hub itself is not an additional repository, but rather harmonises the metadata of the connected RDIs into a standardised metadata schema.
The entries are limited to the metadata of the data sets and can be searched and filtered on the basis of this metadata.
In addition to the usual bibliographic metadata, such as author, publication date or infrastructure, agricultural metadata such as soil type or crop species are also available.
Further options are currently under development.

The second search function of the FAIRagro Search Hub is the **infrastructure search**.
While the data search focuses on finding existing data sets for reuse, the infrastructure search offers the possibility to search for suitable RDIs for publishing your own data.  
The infrastructure search is currently still under development, but will be available soon.

The FAIRagro Search Hub development team works closely with experts at FAIRagro, especially those involved in the Use Cases, to develop the platform in close alignment with the needs of the community.
In addition, anyone who uses the Search Hub is invited to leave comments and suggestions via the green feedback box on the right-hand side of the screen.

## SciWIn Client
SciWIn Client is a command-line tool for building reproducible data pipelines using the _Common Workflow Language (CWL)_. SciWIn Client helps researchers define individual analysis steps as CWL specifications and assemble them into complete workflows with simple commands.
By formalizing analytical processes, SciWIn Client improves reproducibility, transparency, and reusability of computational methods. It facilitates documentation, versioning, and sharing of workflows, supporting collaborative and sustainable research practices.
