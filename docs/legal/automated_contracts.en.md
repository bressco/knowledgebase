There are different approaches to ease the reuse of data, be it by 
researchers or "autonomous" applications. One aspect of this reuse are 
legal questions, e.g. license terms. Some of these approaches work by 
automation of such contracts.

Both a "license" and a data usage agreement are contracts. According 
to the (german) jurisdiction such contracts can be entered into by 
machines. In the end a contract is an agreement between two humans. As 
such it needs a declaration of intent. But the declaration of the 
machine is accounted to the human using it, for example because they 
added relevant legal metadata.[^1] Consequently, a contract can be 
entered into purely based on legal metadata, based e.g. on the ODRL 
standard.
