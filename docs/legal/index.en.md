# Which legal issues do I need to consider in research data management?

**Legal issues** also play a recurring role in research data management (RDM).
FAIRagro has set itself the task of making this **aspect of RDM** accessible and understandable to the agrosystem research community.


## Legal topics
Law takes various forms in RDM.
However, one focus is on the **legal classification of data** and the resulting rights to data:  
*What rights exist in terms of data?* &rarr; [Data rights](rights.md)

**Access** to various types of **“IoT data”**[^1] (such as from measuring sensors) can be opened up by the EU Data Act:  
*What is the EU Data Act and what data access does it enable?* &rarr; [EU Data Act](access.md)

**Automation** of contracts and agreements could simplify the work of 
researchers. *What effect does that have on contracts?* 

Die **Automatisierung** verschiedener Vereinbarungen soll die Arbeit 
Forschender erleichtern. *Wie wirkt sich das auf Verträge aus?* &rarr; 
[Automated Contracts](automated_contracts.md)

[^1]: IoT stands for **Internet of Things**. It refers to the network of physical devices equipped with sensors and software that can communicate with each other via the internet.


## Legal Blog
Our [FAIRagro Blog](https://fairagro.net/en/blog/) contains several articles by our [legal science colleagues](https://fairagro.net/fairagro_team_category/fiz-karlsruhe/).
The following (legal) questions arise in this context:

## Training opportunities
Legal issues are (almost) always addressed in our FAIRagro training courses.
However, they are of particular focus in our [Legal Workshop Series](https://fairagro.net/en/legal-workshop-series/) **“Don't panic! Survival guide for Law and Ethics in Research”**, which we conduct in cooperation with NFDI4Biodiversity and NFDI4Earth. 

Further information on the (general) training opportunities can be found [here](../training.md).
