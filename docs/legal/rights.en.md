What rights exist for data? This depends on one hand on the [type of
data](../specific_data.de.md) and on the other hand on the degree of
processing of the data. Legal peculiarities of the respective data 
types are listed there. This document, however, offers a general 
introduction to rights for data. This is done by differentiating 
between various
“levels of processing” of data: raw data, annotated data and compiled 
data.

!!!Abstract
  Measurement data is usually not protected. However, recordings and 
  the annotations of measurements can be protected. Often, the case 
  depends on the specific situation.

# Levels of Processing

The different types of data can be processed to different degrees. The 
following distinctions can be made: raw data, annotated data and 
compiled data.

## Raw Data

Raw data are data that have been recorded “as is” and have not been 
further processed.

## Annotated Data {#subdivision-processing-levels-annotation}

Annotated data refers to data that has been labeled by humans. This 
gives it additional information. Examples of annotating data include 
marking plants in images, providing headings for (legal) norms, or 
assessing whether a statement in a survey is legally correct.
Depending on the type of annotation, the labels assigned by the 
annotators may differ significantly from one another. These 
differences can, to some extent, be attributed to the subjectivity of 
the assignments.[^1]

## Compiled Data

Compiled data refers to datasets that have been compiled according to 
a specific criterion (e.g., representativeness).

# Overview of Rights for Data

## Copyright {#overview-copyright}

Protection as a work under the UrhG (Urheberrechtsgesetz, Copyright 
Act) requires at least a personal creative act. The work must meet the 
so-called “creative threshold” (§ 2 Abs. 2 UrhG, for database works § 
4 UrhG). A personal creative act exists if the work is based on a 
human-creative activity. As long as a machine is used just as an aid, 
such a creative act may be possible if a human has shaping 
influence.[^3]

At least individual data is acquired according to (specialized) 
specifications, so that the researcher has no sufficient creative 
leeway. Consequently, the requirements of § 2 (2) and § 4 UrhG are not 
met to justify copyright protection.

The concept of computer programs does not entail protection of the 
data resulting from their use. These data are generally not created by 
the program itself or rather not “contained” in the program.[^5]

### Raw Data

Due to lack of creativity, raw data are not protected by copyright.

### Annotated Data {#annotated-data-1}

Depending on the kind of label used for annotation the annotators have 
more or less leeway regarding their decisions. In this context the 
[subjectivity of 
annotations](#subdivision-processing-levels-annotation) can play a 
role, as the UrhG is protecting this subjectivity.[^6] There does not 
need to be much subjectivity,[^7] so that annotations could be 
copyrightable.

Whether such protection is given can only be answered in individual 
cases. When assessing this, the [DSSC](https://fairagro.net/helpdesk/) 
can help.

### Compiled Data {#compiled-data-1}

Through the compilation and curation of data, copyright protection may 
arise.[^8]

Whether such protection is given can only be answered in individual 
cases. When assessing this, the [DSSC](https://fairagro.net/helpdesk/) 
can be helpful.

## Database protection, §§ 87a--87e UrhG

A dataset may also be protected as a database by §§ 87a--87e UrhG. 
This is a protection for invested work, as it does not depend on the 
creative activity of a person, but on the investment and work. 
Therefore, the rights of ownership do not depend on the creator of the 
work, but on the database manufacturer. A further difference from 
copyright is that the database manufacturer only has exclusive rights 
to reproduce the _essential_ parts of the database. This implies that 
any person may reproduce non-essential parts, in addition to the 
exceptions in § 87c UrhG.

For a dataset to be considered a database protected under §§ 87a UrhG, 
it must meet five conditions: It must consist of a collection of 
works, data, or other independent elements; these elements must be 
systematically or methodically arranged; they must be individually 
accessible through electronic means or in another way; and finally, 
the acquisition, verification, or presentation must represent a 
significant investment.

The concept of a “collection” iS of § 87a UrhG is the compilation
of numerous elements.[^9]

Independent elements exist if the elements can be extracted from the 
database and still retain a sufficient informational value.[^10] 
Whether such informational value exists is to be assessed from the 
perspective of a interested third party.[^11] It is sufficient if 
anyone can do something with the extracted elements. While this may 
not apply to a single date, it may apply to data segments of 
sufficient length.

The arrangement is systematic if the collection itself is organized 
according to a system, a classification or a structured order.[^12]
The arrangement is methodically if the collection itself follows a 
specific ordering instruction or plan.[^13] In the case of electronic 
databases, this is mainly about searchability, which requires data 
processing with ordering criteria.[^14]

Access to individual elements is considered possible if the collection 
includes a suitable access system, such as a query system or an index 
that enables individual access.[^15]

A substantial investment within the meaning of § 87a UrhG must firstly 
relate to the acquisition, verification, or presentation of the 
elements. This means that not every investment in connection with the 
database can be considered. In particular, the generation of data is 
not covered, but only the subsequent steps, since it is the database 
and not the data that is protected.[^16]

Secondly, there must be an investment and it must be substantial.
Investments are not only financial expenses, but also any
investment of time, labour, and energy.[^17] The investment is
substantial if it is not entirely insignificant and could not be 
easily made by anyone.[^18] In most cases, however, machine-generated
data is produced ‘incidentally’, so that there is no corresponding
investment.[^19]

### Raw data

Raw data as merely unordered records does not meet the
requirements for systematic or methodical arrangement, so that
it cannot be regarded as a database within the meaning of § 87a UrhG.

### Annotated data {#annotated-data-1}

Annotated data does not necessarily have to be arranged, as
data is ‘only’ enriched without changing its arrangement.

Whether such protection is provided can only be answered on a case-by-case basis.
The [DSSC](https://fairagro.net/helpdesk/) can assist with the 
assessment.

### Compiled data

Compiled data is likely to be protected under §§ 87a
ff. UrhG.

Whether such protection applies can only be determined on a case-by-case basis.
The [DSSC](https://fairagro.net/helpdesk/) can assist with the 
assessment.

## Protection of Photographs, § 72 UrhG {#überblick-lichtbildschutz}

Even without the necessary level of creativity, photographs may be 
protected under § 72 UrhG. The prerequisite for this is, on the one 
hand, the creation of
an ‘original image’ by depicting something. In other words, mere 
reproduction, for example by means of a copy, is not
sufficient.[^20]
On the other hand, the creation must require a minimum level of skill,
which may lie, for example, in the operation of the respective device.
[^21] This means that automated recordings are not necessarily 
excluded from the protection.[^22]

The scope of protection largely corresponds to ‘normal’
copyright law.[^23]

Whether such protection is granted can only be answered on a 
case-by-case basis.
The [DSSC](https://fairagro.net/helpdesk/) can assist with the 
assessment.

## Patent Law {#patent-law}

Protection under patent law, according to § 1 (1) PatG (Patentgesetz, 
German Patent Act), is contingent on the patentability of the subject 
matter of the (pursued) patent. This would require an invention to 
exist first. Although there is no fixed definition of an invention; 
rather, it changes over time with the changing state of science and 
technology.[^24] However, a technical teaching is now considered a 
necessary, if not sufficient, component of the invention. This means 
that a technician can repeatedly solve a problem using the patent and 
work accordingly.[^25]
Data as such do not constitute an instruction for solving a problem, 
but merely represent reality. Therefore, data are not patentable due 
to the absence of a technical teaching.[^26]

## Trade Secret Law, §§ 1 ff. GeschGehG

Trade secret protection is not based on the data structure, but on the 
underlying information.

This information must be secret, have an economic value and 
appropriate confidentiality measures must be taken and a legitimate 
interest in confidentiality must exist. Finally, it is disputed 
whether the information must be company-related.

According to § 2 No. 1 lit. a GeschGehG (Geschäftsgeheimnisgesetz, 
Trade Secret Act), information is secret if it is not in general 
knowledge or readily accessible to people in the circles who normally 
deal with this type of information. 

This is certainly the case if all components are unknown to 
others.[^27] A data collection is also secret in this sense if
the individual data is publicly accessible, but the
structure is not.[^28] This does not apply if the data
can be created at any time without great effort from generally 
accessible sources.[^29] Information is also secret if it is only 
known to persons who are bound to confidentiality,
even if this involves many persons.[^30]

Confidentiality ceases to apply if the information is disclosed
without sufficient confidentiality agreements or
protective measures being in place.[^31] This does not apply if the
information is published unlawfully. Otherwise, the protection
provided by the GeschGehG would be undermined.[^32]

Economic value exists if commercial use
of the data is possible, even if only because of the secrecy
of the data.[^33] A potential value that is only realised through evaluation
is sufficient.[^34]
