# How to learn and teach RDM â€“ a collection

FAIRagro has compiled **learning and teaching materials on research data management for the agrosystems research community**.
These resources are designed to help you **learn** about research data management (RDM), especially in the agricultural sciences.
**Teachers** can reuse many of the resources collected to design their own training courses on discipline-specific RDM.

Here we offer you a quick overview of the learning and teaching resources we have compiled with a brief description, keywords and direct links to the resources.
We will publish these data in the DALIA catalog in the Knowledge Graph for Open Educational Resources on RDM and then include a searchable and filterable display here.

If you are looking for more detailed information, you will these in our [Excel table with more information on the individual teaching and learning resources with detailed descriptions of the resources](https://zenodo.org/records/11148701), information on learning objectives, target groups, authors and funders.
This table allows you to filter for resources that are particularly suitable for learning yourself, or for materials that can be reused by teachers.
You can also filter by other criteria such as language, format, target group, domain and license to find the right resource.
