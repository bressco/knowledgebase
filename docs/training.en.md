# Where can I find training opportunities and/or learning and teaching materials on the topic of RDM?

The topic of research data management (RDM) is diverse.
For those looking for general (generic) information, we have compiled a list of helpful resources [here](basics.md).
Subject-specific information on [RDM in agrosystem research](rdm/index.md) can be found directly here in our Knowledge Base.

Many aspects of RDM can be easily learned independently.
In addition to the above-mentioned information resources, there are also **learning materials** for self-study and **teaching resources** for further training others.
There is also the option of participating in **training** in the field of RDM.


## Training opportunities

FAIRagro organises various trainings (some in collaboration with different partners).
An overview of upcoming training events - both our own and other relevant courses - can be found in the [training calendar](https://fairagro.net/en/events/trainings/){:target="_blank"} on the FAIRagro website.

If you have any questions about training, please take a look at our website in the [Trainig & Education](https://fairagro.net/en/community/training-education/){:target="_blank"} section or get in contact with our [training coordinator](https://fairagro.net/en/fairagro_team_category/measure-2-4/){:target="_blank"} or the [helpdesk](https://fairagro.net/en/helpdesk/#helpdesk-form){:target="_blank"}.


## Learning and teaching materials

### Collection of learning and teaching materials

	Boße *et al.* (2024): [**How to Learn and Teach Research Data Management in Agrosystem Research - a FAIRagro Collection**](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11148701){:target="_blank"}


There is a wide range of learning and teaching materials available (especially online).
To make it easier to find your way around, we have compiled a [collection of learning and teaching materials on handling research data](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11148701){:target="_blank"}[^1] for the agrosystem research community.
These resources are intended to support further education in the field of RDM, especially in agricultural sciences.
Teachers can reuse many of the collected resources to design their own training courses on discipline-specific RDM.

This collection (in the form of an Excel table) contains detailed descriptions of the resources, information on learning objectives, target groups, authors and sponsors.
The table allows you to filter by resources that are particularly suitable for self-study, for example, or by materials that can be reused by teachers.
Other criteria such as language, format, target group, domain and licence can also be filtered specifically.

### Training module

As part of the FAIRagro project, a detailed **training module** on RDM in agrosystem research is currently being developed.  
This training module contains the slides and content used in our training courses and is designed for reuse (especially by teachers).  
As soon as further information is available, you will find it here and on the FAIRagro website.


### Specific materials (examples)

#### Cooperation with the University of Kassel

At the end of 2024/beginning of 2025, FAIRagro collaborated with the University of Kassel to design and implement a three-part training course on **“Research Data Management in Agricultural Sciences”**.
In addition to a [general introduction](https://doi.org/10.4126/FRL01-006428881), advanced training courses were offered on the topics of “[data documentation](https://doi.org/10.4126/FRL01-006428850){:target=‘_blank’}” and “[data publication](https://doi.org/10.4126/FRL01-006426818){:target=‘_blank’}”.
The materials are published on Zenodo:

#### Legal Workshop Series

As part of the [Legal Workshop Series](https://fairagro.net/en/legal-workshop-series/) **“Don't panic! Survival guide for Law and Ethics in Research”**, organised by FAIRagro, NFDI4Biodiversity and NFDI4Earth, the first episode, “[Datenschutz auf dem Silbertablett](https://doi.org/10.4126/FRL01-006402743){:target=‘_blank’}”, was conducted in April 2025 by Lea Singson and Sophie Boße.
The materials, incl. the recording, are also published on Zenodo (German only):
