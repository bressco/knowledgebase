# Where can I find information on agriculture-specific RDM?

FAIRagro mainly deals with **subject-specific research data management** (RDM) for the **agrosystem research community**.  
For general questions, you can find some useful links to general (generic) RDM content [here](../basics.md).


## Questions about data handling
In agrosystem research, there is a variety of **data types**, each with their own specific characteristics in terms of both RDM and legal aspects:  
*What data types exist in agrosystem science? What do I have to consider when collecting and publishing data - including the legal perspective?*
&rarr; [Agriculture-specific Data](specific_data.md)

Different types of data require different **repositories**:  
*Where to find a fitting repository?*
&rarr; [Repositories](data_repositories.md)

Data is often analysed using scientific **code**, which should also be **published FAIR**:  
*How to publish research code FAIR?*
